# Link-state-routing
Java program that first get the UDP port number as a command line parameter and create a UDP socket to listen to. It then should wait for user to enter neighbors’ port numbers and cost, Enter the neighbors’ port numbers and cost for each node. When a node learns a new link etc, print the current view of the network at each node, so that we can see how your program works. Implement Dijktra’s algorithm to compute the shortest path tree based on the current view of the network it should be a general implementation to work with any topology. 


Run: ./bashpgm <port numbers seprated by space>
    eg:  ./bashpgm 2222 3333 4444
